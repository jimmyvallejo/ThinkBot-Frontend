-- Students get redirected to the chat page which asks you what subject you need help with. After making a selection you gain access to Thinkbot, an AI who gives you personalized responses based on your age range as well as which subject you chose. The student also has the option to üëç whichever responses they felt they liked most.

-- Teachers get redirected to the teacher dashboard, where the teacher has access to data, including how many questions were asked per subject, as well as what questions each student liked. This allows teachers to address which subjects students need the most help with, as well as to see what type of answers students responded best to.
